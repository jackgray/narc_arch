EEG + fMRI 
------------
EEG and fMRI data collected in tandem can open a world of 
possibilities, but also open up a world of obstacles. The 
RF pulses generated by the gradient magnet during excitation 
completely disrupt the electrodes of the EEG, and noise 
filtering can become difficult to impossible.

Here are some possible solutions. 

BrainAmp by Brain Products
    ExG MR - Integrate with peripheral physio
        "The increased interest in simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings 
        to investigate brain activity very quickly led to the need 
        to also co-register other types of physiological data such 
        as bipolar and peripheral signals. The BrainAmp ExG MR 
        bridges this gap and makes the recording of bipolar and 
        polygraphic signals in the MRI environment a simple procedure."

    MR Plus - MR compatible EEG amplifier
        "Multiple amplifiers can be combined and stacked on top 
        of each other in order to increase the maximum number of 
        available channels to 128 for recordings in the MRI 
        environment and up to 256 channels for laboratory 
        applications."

    R-Net MR - Electrode cap
        "The R-Net MR consists of saltwater sponges and passive 
        Ag/AgCl electrodes housed in a durable and flexible 
        silicone structure. The MR version of the R-Net also has 
        current limiting resistors for safe recordings in the MRI 
        environment and has a gel-based ECG electrode. The R-Net 
        MR is available for the BrainAmp MR (plus) and can be 
        used in scanners up to 3 T. Its use is subject to our 
        general 3 T EEG-fMRI safety guidelines.

        "The R-Net MR can be equipped with carbon wire loops 
        (CWL) for better correction of motion related artefacts. 
        The CWLs are bipolar channels and the measurement 
        requires a BrainAmp ExG MR."

    SyncBox - phase synchronization
        "Designed to boost data quality for concurrent EEG and fMRI 
        recordings.
        Phase synchronization between the EEG equipment and the MRI 
        scanner results in temporal stability of the EEG acquisition 
        in relation to the switching of the gradients during the MR 
        acquisition. This leads to significant improvement of the 
        recorded data quality

        It significantly reduces timing related errors and boosts the 
        quality of MRI artifact correction by synchronizing the clock 
        of the BrainAmp MR / BrainAmp MR plus amplifier with the clock 
        driving the MRI scanner’s gradient switching system.""

    KRIOS - Co-registration 
        "KRIOS by Northern Digital Instruments NDI is an infrared 
        camera system including software to digitize individual, 
        real-life electrode positions. In order to work with 
        KRIOS system the electrodes will be equipped with 
        permanent reflectors in a high quality and precise manner.

        Receive real-time scanning feedback – scanner LED status 
        indicator lights notify operators of successful/failed 
        marker acquisition, while the software provides a running 
        tally of localized markers."

NeurOne Tesla by Cortech
    "a fMRI and TMS compatible EEG system with precise 24-bit AD 
    conversion, reliable temporal synchronization with the 
    scanner clock enabled by Tesla’s 80 kHz sample rate and 
    an optimal combination of the spatial information from 
    fMRI with the abundant temporal information from EEG. 
    Advanced amplifier design enables using both AC and DC 
    recording modes the way you want."
