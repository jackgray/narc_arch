Cloud Resources

CloudBank
----------
In addition to resources available through CloudBank-eligible NSF 
solicitations, CloudBank makes modest resources available on a 
non-competitive basis in support of various community purposes, 
including but not limited to: classes, workshops and training, 
exploratory purposes, such as preparing estimates for proposal 
of CloudBank-eligible solicitations, and hosting of community 
data sets. Resource requests are reviewed and made available on 
an as-available basis with no specific deadlines. As the name 
implies, community resource requests should benefit larger groups 
of people and researchers. Requests are reviewed by CloudBank 
project PIs, staff and others as appropriate for the nature of 
the request. Turnaround time for reviews is typically no more than 
5 business days.

"The NSF “Open Cloud Testbed” (OCT) project will build and support a testbed 
for research and experimentation into new cloud platforms – the underlying 
software which provides cloud services to applications. Testbeds such as OCT 
are critical for enabling research into new cloud technologies – research that 
requires experiments which potentially change the operation of the cloud itself."
