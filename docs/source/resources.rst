Its good to keep a tab of methods employed by other leading 
institutes. This page serves as a working reference of those 
centers and links to their resources.

XSEDE us being transitioned to NSF's ACCESS

U-Mass Amherst
--------------
A progressive looking research computing program that should 
be tracked. One of their objectives is to integrate access 
to the NSF's computing resources, among others.

Mass Open Cloud 
---------------

Reproducible Cloud 
    A core tenet of the Open Cloud eXchange model is the ability to 
    reproduce and manage federated clouds. These projects feed directly 
    into MOC operations and form the foundation for the Open Infra Labs 
    and NERC initiatives.


NERC - New England Research Cloud 
-----------------------------------
https://nerc.mghpcc.org

The vision of the New England Research Cloud (NERC) is to create a regional 
resource, rich with world-class cloud computing services. We are building a 
common cloud framework that is tailored for data-driven discovery and will 
be available to many institutions in New England. 

This sustainable partnership is aimed at bringing together research clusters 
and technology professionals.  The robust computer science research focusing 
on cloud technology coupled with strong industry collaboration,  will create 
the opportunity for the innovation space to flourish and will allow domain 
scientists to have access to technology not found elsewhere.  This approach 
sets NERC apart from todayâ€™s public clouds and is critical to bridging the 
gap in skills that are needed for research and teaching professionals. 

NERC Goals:
Build a cost effective professionally operated on-prem cloud service that 
includes various levels of services:

    -   Self-service Software-as-a-Service for easy access
    -   Automated Platform-as-a-Service for custom workflows Standardized
    -   Infrastructure-as-a-Service that includes emerging technologies for hardware acceleration
    -   Through facilitation we will increase the capabilities of:

    -   Researchers and research collaborations
    -   The emerging workforce leaving local universities
    -   The innovation hubs and start-ups connected to our universities

Set standards of deployment and automation that will allow other institutions 
to easily deploy the full suite of services built within NERC.


OpenInfra Labs (OILabs)
------------------------
https://openinfralabs.org

OpenInfra Labs (OI Labs) is the new effort established in partnership with 
Open Infrastructure Foundation and Mass Open Cloud. OILabs is created with 
the goal to expand the existing community and simplify and standardize how 
different institutions deploy and operate open source cloud infrastructure 
and cloud native software.

Initially, OILabs will prioritize the needs of the MOC and NERC environments. 
Longer term the goal is to see more organizations globally (especially in the 
academic and research space) stand up multiple consistent clouds that can enable 
hybrid and federated use cases.  If you are building or operating open source 
based clouds and would like to help standardize the process for creating them, 
we invite you to get involved and participate in OpenInfra Labs today!

A great place to see the direction OILabs is heading as we define the environment 
which will become the MOC and the NERC is at 
https://gitlab.com/open-infrastructure-labs.

We are focused on delivering open source tools to build and run cloud, container,
 AI, big data and edge workloads efficiently, repeatedly and predictably. Our 
 projects embrace three themes:

Operate First - helping developers gain insights into operational considerations 
and ensure their projects will integrate and operate well in production environments. 
Learn More.

Low-Code Development - enabling developers to build production-grade AI and big data 
applications without specialized skills and with a minimal level of coding.

Optimized Infrastructure - delivering infrastructure innovations to improve the 
performance of emerging workloads without burdening application developers.
