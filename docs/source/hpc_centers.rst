U-Mass Amherst
--------------
A progressive looking research computing program that should 
be tracked. One of their objectives is to integrate access 
to the NSF's computing resources, among others.

CloudBank
----------
In addition to resources available through CloudBank-eligible NSF 
solicitations, CloudBank makes modest resources available on a 
non-competitive basis in support of various community purposes, 
including but not limited to: classes, workshops and training, 
exploratory purposes, such as preparing estimates for proposal 
of CloudBank-eligible solicitations, and hosting of community 
data sets. Resource requests are reviewed and made available on 
an as-available basis with no specific deadlines. As the name 
implies, community resource requests should benefit larger groups 
of people and researchers. Requests are reviewed by CloudBank 
project PIs, staff and others as appropriate for the nature of 
the request. Turnaround time for reviews is typically no more than 
5 business days.
