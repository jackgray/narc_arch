EEG + fMRI 
------------
EEG and fMRI data collected in tandem can open a world of 
possibilities, but also open up a world of obstacles. The 
RF pulses generated by the gradient magnet during excitation 
completely disrupt the electrodes of the EEG, and noise 
filtering can become difficult to impossible.

Here are some possible solutions. 

BrainAmp by Brain Products
    ExG MR - integrate with other physio
        "The increased interest in simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings 
        to investigate brain activity very quickly led to the need 
        to also co-register other types of physiological data such 
        as bipolar and peripheral signals. The BrainAmp ExG MR 
        bridges this gap and makes the recording of bipolar and 
        polygraphic signals in the MRI environment a simple procedure."

    MR Plus - MR compatible EEG amp 
        "Multiple amplifiers can be combined and stacked on top 
        of each other in order to increase the maximum number of 
        available channels to 128 for recordings in the MRI 
        environment and up to 256 channels for laboratory 
        applications."

NeurOne Tesla by Cortech
    "a fMRI and TMS compatible EEG system with precise 24-bit AD 
    conversion, reliable temporal synchronization with the 
    scanner clock enabled by Teslaâ€™s 80 kHz sample rate and 
    an optimal combination of the spatial information from 
    fMRI with the abundant temporal information from EEG. 
    Advanced amplifier design enables using both AC and DC 
    recording modes the way you want."

MNE-Python
------------
MNE-Python software is an open-source Python package for 
exploring, visualizing, and analyzing human neurophysiological 
data such as MEG, EEG, sEEG, ECoG, and more. It includes 
modules for data input/output, preprocessing, visualization, 
source estimation, time-frequency analysis, connectivity 
analysis, machine learning, and statistics.

BVTools CLI 
-----------
BV2BIDS is a command line tool that creates the EEG-BIDS 
folder hierarchy from BVCD files.
