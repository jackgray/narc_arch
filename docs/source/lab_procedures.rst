Here is a basic outline for taking a participant through an MRI session at BMEII

-   Complete screening paperwork
-   Check participant into MRI main desk at Hess Center
-   Check participant in with registered nurse (office before mock scanning room)
-   Show participant to locker room and bathrooms
-   Provide participant with scrubs to change into, instruct them to remove all metal
-   Double check that they have no exclusionary conditions or implants
-   Enter MRI suite, provide technologist with paperwork
-   Prepare first task for eyetracking calibration, ensure camera view is on the screen
-   Ask tech if it's ok to bring the participant in
-   Watch security camera of hallway to see if participant has exited change rooms and trying to enter the suite
-   Check on participant after considerable time to see if they are waiting in the change room or need anything
-   Gauge how they are feeling and quell any anxieties or concern
-   Sit participant down in chair by MRI control room door
-   Use prep gel to clean fingers 3 and 4 (middle and ring)
-   Place electrodes (EL502 found in cabinet above task PC) on foreside of fingers, then secure them with tape
-   When tech is ready, proceed to scanner room for MRI setup
-   Move eyetracking camera into position and make sure the participant's eye is in frame and in focus
-   Make sure tech places SCR/GSR leads onto electrodes, and pulse-ox onto finger
-   Return to console room after participant is loaded into the scanner
-   Test eyetracking quality with calibration setup and reposition if necessary
-   Locate e-prime tasks folder on paradigm PC
-   Wait for tech to be ready for BOLD scans
-   Check quality of T1 (and others)
-   Run tasks in the order they are listed
