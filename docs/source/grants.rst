"PPoSS specifically seeks to fund projects that span the entire 
hardware/software stack and that lay the foundations for sustainable 
approaches for implementing performant, scalable, and correct and 
accurate computing applications that run on heterogeneous platforms."

NSF - CISE Community Research Infrastructure 
---------------------------------------------
https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22509/nsf22509.htm?WT_mc_id=USNSF_27&WT_mc_ev=click

:Deadline:  June 23, 2022 (annually thereafter)

The CCRI program supports three classes of awards:
    **Planning Community Infrastructure (Planning)** awards support planning 
    efforts to engage research communities to develop new CISE community 
    research infrastructures. Such an infrastructure could be eventually 
    funded through the CCRI program (Planning-C) or the NSF mid-scale 
    research infrastructure programs (Planning-M). For the scope of 
    mid-scale research infrastructure proposals, see the most recent 
    solicitation NSF 21-505.

    **Medium Community Infrastructure (Medium)** awards support the creation 
    of new CISE community research infrastructure or the enhancement of 
    existing CISE community research infrastructure with integrated tools, 
    resources, user services, and research community outreach to enable 
    innovative CISE research opportunities to advance the frontiers of the 
    CISE core research areas. The Medium award class includes New (New) and 
    Enhance/Sustain (ENS) awards.

    **Grand Community Infrastructure (Grand)** awards support projects involving 
    significant efforts to develop new CISE community research infrastructure 
    or to enhance and sustain an existing CISE community research infrastructure 
    to enable world-class CISE research opportunities for broad-based communities 
    of CISE researchers that extend well beyond the awardee organization(s).

Each CCRI Medium or Grand award may include support for operation of the 
infrastructure, ensuring that the awardee organization(s) is (are) well 
positioned to provide a high quality of service to CISE community 
researchers expected to use the infrastructure to realize their research goals.

:Deadline: Anytime for small grants, passed for medium and large 

:Award Amount: $600,000

:Type:  Standard or Continuing Grant 

:Total Available: 400-600 / $280,000,000 (estimated)

Apply through: 
    -   Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF)
        -   Algorithmic Foundations program 
        -   Communications and Information Foundations program
    -   Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS Core)
    -   Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS)
        -   Human-Centered Computing (HCC) program 
        -   Information Integration and Informatics (III) program 
        -   Robust Intelligence (RI) program 

Suggested routes:
    -   **CNS Core** program supports research that advances computer and network 
    systems, develops a better understanding of the fundamental properties and 
    tradeoffs involved, as well as the abstractions and tools used in designing, 
    building, measuring, and using them; 
    -   **Information Integration and Informatics (III)** program supports research 
    on computational approaches to the full data lifecycle to maximize the 
    utility of information resources;

"Small projects, with total budgets up to $600,000 for durations of up to three 
years, are well suited to one or two investigators (PI and one co-PI or other 
Senior Personnel) and at least one student and/or postdoctoral researcher. A 
Collaboration Plan (up to two pages) may be provided under Supplementary 
Documents. Please see Proposal Preparation Instructions Section V.A for 
additional submission guidelines."

"Proposals may request cloud computing resources to use public clouds such as 
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM Cloud, and Microsoft 
Azure. Cloud computing resources described in proposals may be obtained through 
an external cloud access entity (CloudBank) supported by NSFâ€™s Enabling Access 
to Cloud Computing Resources for CISE Research and Education (Cloud Access) 
program."
