Form Generation
========================

Researchers need an easy way to interact with their data 
    A single source of truth with high-availability, 
    redundancy, and fault tolerance (replication). 

The proposed solution laid forth aims to:
-   Replace MS Access 
-   Make central data consumable by layperson (without needing familiarity of query language)
-   Upload data via CSV
-   Redcap integration

Microsoft Access
-----------------
Currently, forms are generated by MS Access, which serves as both 
a database and frontend GUI for form creation and other automations. 


MongoDB integration 
    https://www.progress.com/odbc/mongodb

Pros: 
    -   Free with MS Office 365 Suite 
    -   Already implemented and working 

Cons:
    -   Proprietary data format (.accdb and .mdb)
    -   Not Python friendly
    -   Unpopular user interface 
    -   Not open-source 
    -   Limited outside integrations
    -   Not easy enough for layperson to access data


Budibase
----------
Budibase offers an intuitive web gui for viewing this data store 
and creating documents and forms from it. Similar to Airtable or 
the MS Access frontend, only it can be self-hosted on the pre-existing  
Kubernetes cluster and is fully customizable. Because they offer 
their own hosting solution, and already have a revenue model, there 
is good chance that the self-hosted solution will remain free and 
open-source. 

By storing our data in MongoDB or PostgreSQL, rather than MS Access 
proprietary .accdb or .mdb format, we make it available and easily 
consumable by all of our services, including direct calls by  
python and matlab scripting.

-   Connects to existing database (PostgreSQL, Mongo, etc.)
-   Allows easy graphical manipulation and addition of data via 
    web interface. 
  
Advantages over MS Access or Airtable:
    -   Free 
    -   HIPAA compliant
        -   Airtable uses a cloud platform that does not meet the criteria for HIPAA compliance, 
        and can therefore not be used to host PHI.
        -   Budibase can be self-hosted, providing complete control over security methods
    -   Small learning curve 
    -   Distributed storage (sharding): the ability to break up the database in to chunks, or "shards" 
        accross multiple cluster nodes for load balancing requests 
    -   Intuitive automation pipeline creation interface 
        -   Easily create workflows and notification systems within 
        the user web interface. No code required. 
    -   Upload of data via CSV
    -   Combine tables and export them as CSV or JSON
    -   Ultimate data control: hosting, format, presentation 
    -   Data backend agnostic, independent
    -   Data is stored in a non-proprietary format and located outside of Budibase
        -   can be accessed by any other service or script. 
    -   Data is controlled by a single source, but can 
        exist in multiple sources.
    -   Replication: the ability to seamlessly sync data to multiple sources, as if it were one 
        -   Minimizes outages by offering more than one server for access. 



Redcap Integration 
-------------------
Data from RedCap can be automatically exported as JSON or CSV using 
the RedCap API and cron scheduling, or event triggers.

Advantages
    -   Guaranteed HIPAA compliance 
    -   "Just works" -managed by institute
    -   Built-in audit trails
    -   Caters to researchers 
    -   Claims to play nice with SPSS, SAS, R..

Disadvantages 
    -   Weak documentation 
    -   Small, tight knit community, slow advancement (relative to other solutions)
    -   Does not integrate with other modern DBMS
 
Do we need Budibase *and* RedCap, or one or the other?

AirTable
--------
Not HIPAA Compliant 

KeXi
-----
KeXi claims to be an open-source alternative to MS Access. 
It's free, but only available on Linux.

NocoDB
-------
Open source alternative to Airtable 

Poorly documented and seems less active in development than Budibase
