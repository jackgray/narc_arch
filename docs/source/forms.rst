========================
Form Generation
========================

Researchers need an easy way to interact with their 
data--we need a single source of truth with high-availability 
redundancy, and fault tolerance (replication). 

The proposed solution laid forth aims to:
-   Replace MS Access 
-   Make central data consumable by layperson (without needing familiarity of query language)
-   Upload data via CSV
-   Redcap integration

Microsoft Access
-----------------
Currently, forms are generated by MS Access, which serves as both 
a database and frontend GUI for form creation and other automations. 


MongoDB integration 
    https://www.progress.com/odbc/mongodb

Pros: 
    -   Free with MS Office 365 Suite 


Cons:
    -   Proprietary data format (.accdb and .mdb)
    -   Not Python friendly


Budibase
----------
By storing our data in MongoDB or PostgreSQL, rather than MS Access 
proprietary .accdb or .mdb format, we make it available and easily 
consumable by all of our services, including direct calls by  
python and matlab scripting.

Budibase offers an intuitive web gui for viewing this data store 
and creating documents and forms from it. Similar to Airtable or 
the MS Access frontend, only it can be self-hosted on the same 
kubernetes cluster and is fully customizable. Because they offer 
their own hosting solution, and already have a revenue model, there 
is good chance that the self-hosted solution will remain free and 
open-source. 

-   Connects to existing database (PostgreSQL, Mongo, etc.)
-   Allows easy graphical manipulation and addition of data via 
    web interface. 
  
Advantages over MS Access or Airtable:
    - Free 
    - HIPAA compliant
        - Airtable uses a cloud platform that does not meet the criteria for HIPAA compliance, 
        and can therefore not be used to host PHI.
    -   Little to zero learning curve 
    -   Ultimate data control: hosting, format, presentation 
    -   Daily snapshot backups to MinIO (main cluster storage)
    -   Universal, portable data format 
    -   Replication: the ability to seamlessly sync data to multiple sources, as if it were one 
    -   Distributed storage (sharding): the ability to break up the database in to chunks, or "shards" 
accross multiple cluster nodes for load balancing requests 
    -   Intuitive automation pipeline creation interface 
        -   Easily create workflows and notification systems within 
        the user web interface. No code required. 
    -   Upload of data via CSV
    -   Because data is stored in a non-proprietary format and located outside of budibase, it 
    can be accessed by any other service or script. 
    -   Data is controlled by a single source, but can 
    exist in multiple sources.

Redcap Integration 
-------------------
Budibase could potentially replace RedCap, but there are no obvious 
standardized ways to fuse these two together.

AirFlow
--------
MongoDB Integration
    https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-mongo/stable/connections/mongo.html

Also works with PostgreSQL

Running on Kubernetes

KeXi
-----
KeXi claims to be an open-source alternative to MS Access. 
It's free, but only agailagle on Linux.

NocoDB
-------
Open source alternative to Airtable 

Poorly documented and seems less active in development than Budibase
