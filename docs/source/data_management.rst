Data Management

dbt
----
dbt is a development framework that combines modular SQL with software 
engineering best practices to make data transformation reliable, fast, and fun.

dbt (data build tool) enables analytics engineers to transform data in their 
warehouses by simply writing select statements. dbt handles turning these 
select statements into tables and views.

dbt does the T in ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) processes – it doesn’t extract 
or load data, but it’s extremely good at transforming data that’s already loaded 
into your warehouse.

Satori

Probably overkill for small teams. But takes a lot of legwork 
out of data  management. It is not currently compatible with 
document (JSON) databases.

Satori is a Universal Data Access Service that monitors, classifies, and controls access to sensitive data across the entire data infrastructure.​ 
    Automated and scalable access control: one place to define, enforce and 
    monitor controls, with powerful automation, universally across data stores 
    and tools.

    World-class security: granular security for masking, row/column/object 
    filtering, decryption and more with built-in data classification.
    
    Instant integration with zero disruption: integrates into any environment 
    in minutes without code or changes to data, schema or queries for 
    frictionless DataOps.

Understand your data including the sensitive data with continuous data discovery and classification 
    Satori monitors every database query and result, classifies the 
    data in-motion, keeps a universal audit of data access, and builds 
    an always-up-to-date data inventory including sensitive data such 
    as highly regulated Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and 
    Personal Health Information (PHI).

Protect sensitive data at query run-time with dynamic masking
    Satori enables dynamic masking of sensitive data at query run-time, based 
    on your choice of security policies, and can be set based on identities, 
    data locations, as well as by data types, supporting compliance for GDPR, 
    CCPA and other regulatory requirements.



Provide fine-grained security with access control policies
    Satori enables fine-grained access control, regardless of the data platform you 
    are using, and how you are consuming the data. The granular security you can apply 
    includes Dynamic Masking, Row-Level Security, and ABAC (Attribute Based Access 
    Control). The granular security policies can be applied without the need of data 
    engineering resources, and can be applied across different data platforms at the 
    same time.


Deliver self-service access to data with customized access workflows
    Whether you are working with self-service access, role-based access controls, or 
    attribute-based access controls, Satori facilitates the requests for data access 
    and manages the approval without any added code and without modifying your current 
    data flows. Analysts, data scientists, and engineers can access the data they need 
    quickly and without complex user and role configurations while simultaneously 
    ensuring that security and compliance policies are enforced.

Monitor and audit access to data for compliance requirements with comprehensive reporting
    Satori monitors every database query and result, providing real-time audit trail 
    and visibility into the usage of all data including sensitive data. Satori provides 
    a complete data access audit with identity and data context including built-in 
    reports for compliance and security.

Modeling Tools
-----------------

GenMyModel
    With GenMyModel’s standard data modeling notation, data architects not only keep 
    glossaries and data models under control, but they can design and reverse engineer data 
    models and link them to other IT and business models, such as UML, Archimate and BPMN.
