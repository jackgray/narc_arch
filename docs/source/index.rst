How To Make a Modern Research Cluster
========================================

A modern computing cluster should contain some implementation of the 
following components:
   - Storage 
   - Backup
   - Scheduling
   - Load Balancing
   - User interaction 
   - Database integration
   - System Monitoring
   - Notifications

This documentation aims to address all needs of an analysis 
system. It will serve as a live, evolving store for ideas and 
considerations throughout the design process.
