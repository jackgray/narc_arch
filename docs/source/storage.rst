===========

The storage solution will consist of a primary (hot) distributed system
with 100% fault tolerance, a cold storage hybrid cloud, a rolling 
backup policy to move files as the drive fills into the cold storage,
and a local user interface to seamlessly access the data without any 
additional technical knowledge.

Local / Personal PC Integration with O-Drive
----------------------------------------------
Seamless integration between primary distributed storage 
(Min.io server) and local computers. 

Think DropBox or OneDrive, but personal, on-premise, 
custom-fitted, single source.

From odrive:

Sync unlimited data
    odrive's Infinite Sync shows files available in your storage 
    initially as placeholder cloud files that don't take up any 
    disk space on your computer. Content isn't downloaded until 
    you try to access the file. This saves bandwidth and allows 
    you to sync storage with more data in it than you have hard 
    disk capacity.

Back up important files to any storage
    You can back up any folder on your computer to any storage 
    that you've linked to odrive. Backup automatically keep older 
    versions of files that have been updated or deleted since the 
    last backup run, protecting your data against loss. 

Connect your machines
    You can install the odrive sync app (or lightweight command 
    line sync agent) on unlimited machines. Make it easy to work 
    seamlessly across all of your computers. You can even easily 
    connect your virtual machines to all of your storage by installing 
    odrive and logging in with your odrive account, enabling a whole 
    new world of possibilities.
