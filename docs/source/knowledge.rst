Knowledge Keeping
========================

It's advantageous to have a centralized store of strategies 
and knowledge as it relates to lab specific research tactics 
and methodology. There are a number of benefits to using 
more than a simple file server of Word documents. Ideas can 
be abstracted, linked, tracked, and reformed intuitively. 
Colaboration becomes more fluid, and ideas can be transferred 
accross teams seamlessly.

There are a number of services that offer solutions of various 
flavors, however many of them cost money, come with privacy 
considerations, or require a combination of multiple solutions 
to fit a research lab's specific needs, and may come with 
more managerial overhead than they are worth.
